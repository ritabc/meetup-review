# meetup-review
I attended the Portland Ruby Brigade's monthly meeting on Tuesday, August 7th, 2018 at New Relic. The event was a panel by speakers Michael Smith, Zach Davis, Lauren Voswinkel, and Reid Beels. There was also food and networking. I believe the talk was officially themed around new developments within the Ruby community and specifically the Ruby tech community. They also spoke to many concerns of us who may be new to the community, including topics about the roller coaster effect of language's popularity, and resources for newbies. I'm trying to attend a number of events, to both learn more and network. I met and chatted with a few people, which was great, and received several book and podcast recommendations. The attitude was very welcoming, which I appreciated, and I think the event went very smoothly - I can't think of any critical feedback for this event, and I would definitely recommend this meetup.
